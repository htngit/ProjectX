# Thinking Log

    ## Prompt 1: Initial Setup
    - **Date:** 2024-07-26 10:00:00 UTC
    - **Task:** Create SQL migration script for Supabase.
    - **Design Decisions:**
        - Defined tables for `roles`, `companies`, `user_profiles`, `teams`, `team_members`, and `clients`.
        - Implemented functions for RBAC: `has_role`, `get_user_role_level`, `get_user_company_id`, `get_user_team_id`.
        - Created triggers to enforce RBAC on updates and deletes, and to set the Super Admin role for new companies.
        - Enabled RLS and created policies for `user_profiles`, `teams`, and `clients`.
    - **Reasoning:**
        - The table structure is designed to support a hierarchical RBAC system.
        - Functions and triggers are used to enforce RBAC at the database level.
        - RLS policies ensure that users can only access data within their scope.

    ## Prompt 2: .env Setup
    - **Date:** 2024-07-26 10:15:00 UTC
    - **Task:** Use `.env` to utilize backend.
    - **Design Decisions:**
        - Created a `.env` file to store Supabase URL, anon key, service role key, and project password.
        - Used `VITE_` prefix for client-side variables.
    - **Reasoning:**
        - `.env` files are used to store sensitive information and avoid hardcoding them in the code.
        - `VITE_` prefix ensures that the variables are accessible in the Vite environment.

    ## Prompt 3: Frontend Auth System
    - **Date:** 2024-07-26 10:30:00 UTC
    - **Task:** Proceed next step for auth system (Front End) Up to Get Started Page Step 4.
    - **Design Decisions:**
        - **Project Setup:**
            - Initialized a new Vite project with React.
            - Installed necessary dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `antd`, `tailwindcss`, `recharts`, `chart.js`, `leaflet`, `react-leaflet`, `@supabase/supabase-js`.
        - **Authentication Flow:**
            - Created a basic authentication flow using Supabase Auth.
            - Implemented a "Get Started" page with four steps:
                1. Welcoming message.
                2. Choice between "existing team/company" or "new team/company".
                3. Conditional forms based on the choice in step 2.
                4. Legal agreement with a boolean checkbox.
        - **Component Structure:**
            - Created a `GetStartedPage` component to handle the onboarding process.
            - Used Ant Design components for UI elements.
            - Used Tailwind CSS for styling.
        - **State Management:**
            - Used React's `useState` hook to manage the current step and form data.
    - **Reasoning:**
        - Vite provides a fast development environment.
        - React is used for building the UI components.
        - Ant Design provides pre-built UI components.
        - Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
        - Supabase Auth is used for user authentication.
        - The "Get Started" page is designed to guide users through the onboarding process.
        - Conditional rendering is used to display different forms based on user choices.
        - State management is used to keep track of the current step and form data.
